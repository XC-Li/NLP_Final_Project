a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg,okay auf den ersten blick wirkt das binion cafe √§hm etwas es auch kein caf√© sondern eher ein typisch amerikanisches lokal es ist mitten im casino untergebracht und wird nur mit d√ºnnen w√§nden abgetrennt immerhin gibt es fenster hinaus casino wenn man das lokal betritt wird der erste eindruck nicht besser es sieht alles etwas verlebt aus da wir aber comps hatten und das essen somit fast gratis war haben wir uns trotzdem burger fritten bestellt die bedienung ist typisch amerikanisch aber nicht typisch las vegas nett aber nicht aufdringlich das essen kam nach einer zeitspanne die vermuten l√§√üt dass es frisch zubereitet wurde das hat mich ehrlich gesagt etwas √ºberrascht da ich wirklich geringe erwartungen diesen laden hatte noch mehr √ºberrascht hat mich allerdings das essen die burger waren wirklich gut vor allem wenn man den preis bedenkt und die fritten sehr knusprig mit einer art panade wie burger king sie vor einigen jahren mal hatte die burger werden hier nicht fertig zusammengebaut einige zutaten salat zwiebeln tomaten gurken liegen daneben auf dem teller kann man sich seinen burger ganz nach dem eigenen geschmack zusammenstellen zum burger geh√∂rt entweder kartoffelsalat schmeckt tats√§chlich ziemlich deutsch oder coleslaw gute qualit√§t die fritten m√ºssen extra bestellt werden ca extra die getr√§nkepreise sind las vegas generell etwas h√∂her hier sind sie f√ºr las vegas verh√§ltnisse etwas g√ºnstiger softdrink bier comps werden hier grunds√§tzlich anstandslos akzeptiert trotzdem empfiehlt es sich die rechnung genau zu pr√ºfen comps gutscheine bekommt man auf verschiedene arten als √ºber den american casion guide oder direkt als flyer die hand gedr√ºckt um diese dann zu nutzen muss man kostenlos mitglied im players club werden falls man eh im spielen lohnt sich das doppelt denn man kann dort t√§glich seine clubkarte swipen und comps abr√§umen freeplay slots oder tischspiele oder f√ºrs oder t√§glich wechselnde geschenke auf dem flyer finden sich noch weitere gutscheine f√ºr ein mit einer million dollar gratis spiel mit der sehr geringen chance ein paar tausend dollar zu gewinnen einen las und drinks als bekommt man comps regelm√§√üig √ºbers swipen seiner clubkarte ich w√ºrde hier immer wieder essen und sogar den vollen preis bezahlen wenn es nicht viele comps geben w√ºrde den einen stern abzug gibt es weil es beim ersten mal echt √ºberwindung kostet den laden zu betreten und dort etwas zum essen zu bestellen,4
5iHctUjkQTGwEvOaBkwMRQ,wir hatten gutscheine von und das war der hauptgrund f√ºr den besuch die gutscheine wurden ohne probleme angenommen und entsprechend angerechnet der laden ist sehr klein deutschland w√ºrde man etwas wohl als mit bezeichnen innen gibt es nur sehr wenig sitzpl√§tze au√üen gibt es etwas mehr sitzgelegenheiten aber auch reichlich bettelnde tauben wir hatten uns sandwiches bestellt diese wurden frisch zubereitet und waren gro√üz√ºgig belegt geschmacklich waren die sandwiches okay wir hatten au√üerdem noch eine portion fritten dazu bestellt diese sind aber eher nicht empfehlen etwas matschig der dazu bestellte kaffee einmal normal einmal latte war sehr zu empfehlen die tische waren nur eine regelm√§√üige reinigung der freien tische haben wir nicht miterlebt das publikum besteht haupts√§chlich aus b√ºrokr√§ften die der nachbarschaft arbeiten das espression cafe ist sehr nah der fremont street man geht praktisch auf h√∂he des binions zum golden nugget und dann noch etwas weiter geradeaus wichtig der laden hat nur tags√ºber ge√∂ffnet tipp man bekommt immer sehr g√ºnstig gutscheine √ºber,3
Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ,ich kann nur das casino bewerten da ich das hotel nicht genutzt habe eingang bekommt man √ºblicherweise einen couponflyer zugesteckt diesen sollte man bei seinem erstbesuch unbedingt mitnehmen der flyer enth√§lt gutscheine f√ºr ein mit einer million dollar f√ºr ein gratis spiel mit der sehr geringer chance ein paar tausend dollar zu gewinnen f√ºr einen las und f√ºr ein hat man auf jeden fall schon mal gratis souvenirs kofferanh√§nger foto es lohnt sich dem playersclub vom binions beizutreten denn man kann dort t√§glich seine clubkarte swipen und comps abr√§umen freeplay slots oder tischspiele oder f√ºrs oder t√§glich wechselnde geschenke das ist bunt gemischt von einfachen alten ger√§ten bis zu den neuesten mit vielen features ausgestatteten ger√§ten die bedienung mit getr√§nken geht flott auch wenn man eher rand des casinos sitzt f√ºr die toilette muss man einmal quer durchs casino sie ist immer sauber und gepflegt gewesen die leute vom playersclub sind sehr nett wenn man mal einen coupon f√ºr ein geswipt hat kann man normalerweise zwischen den verf√ºgbaren geschenken w√§hlen wenn man geswipt hat bekommt man das ausgezahlt und kann das freeplay dann auch setzen und nicht unbedingt alles auf einmal das binions geh√∂rt auf jeden fall zum downtown,4
eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,wir waren im mai hier essen wir hatten einen two brunch entrees two well drinks two people f√ºr gekauft der laden ist etwas klein und akustisch eine katastrophe es ist sehr laut wir waren vormittags dort obwohl gar nicht viel platz f√ºr viele leute ist das ist aber auch schon der einzige kritikpunkt wir hatten x den perch burger bier und wir waren sehr zufrieden der burger war sehr gut die pommes hingegen waren nicht wirklich toll eher weich und kein genuss uns ging es eh nur um den burger und der war top und genug zum satt werden die bedienung war sehr freundlich und hat sich regelm√§√üig versichert dass wir alles haben wir brauchen das essen war den preis auf jeden fall wert und das bier war ja auch schon inklusive blieb f√ºr uns vor ort dann nur noch das trinkgeld der wurde ohne diskussion angenommen und verrechnet mit w√ºrden wir wiederkommen ohne eher nicht weil es uns zu laut war,4
-a857YYdjzgOdOjFFRsRXQ,der beer park befindet sich direkt paris hotel casino √ºber dem hexx man nimmt entweder au√üen die treppe nach oben oder innen den aufzug wir waren fr√ºhen mittag direkt zur √∂ffnung dort die bedienung und auch das personal empfang hatte es wohl gar nicht eilig wir mussten n√§mlich ziemlich warten es lief zwar viel personal herum um die tische mit so√üentr√§gern einzudecken aber wir wurden zun√§chst ignoriert obwohl noch gar keine anderen g√§ste da waren wir bekamen dann einen tisch zugewiesen und nach einer weile kam dann tats√§chlich auch eine bedienung unseren tisch von da gab es personaltechnisch nichts mehr zu meckern denn unsere bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam wir hatten einen burger einen caesars salat und ein mit brisket anfangs sa√üen wir noch im schatten sp√§ter wanderte dieser dass wir halb der sonne sa√üen tipp bei hei√üen sonnenwetter m√∂glichst nah geb√§ude und nicht zur stra√üe hin sitzen zur k√ºhlung wurde dann die wasserdampfanlage angemacht ich pers√∂nlich hasse diese dinger die es leider inzwischen fast jeder ecke strip gibt aber das ist wohl geschmackssache zum gl√ºck haben wir davon unserem tisch nur wenig abbekommen wie man sich schon beim namen denken kann ist die hauptspezialit√§t vom beer park bier auch wenn der ganze laden mit budweiser gebrandet ist bekommt hier biersorten aus aller welt auch aus deutschland tipp der theke kann man kostenlos einzelne biersorten probieren einfach nachfragen wir haben jedenfalls eine neue leckere biersorte gefunden zuf√§lligerweise sogar aus las vegas das essen kam im normalen zeitrahmen wichtig ist wie schon erw√§hnt sind biere die hauptspezialit√§t den speisen kommt hier nur eine nebenrolle zu sie werden serviert dass man sie tisch mit allen teilen kann und es gibt wohl nur plastikgeschirr der burger war saftig und mittelm√§√üig lecker v√∂llig okay aber nichts besonderes f√ºr den preis auf jeden fall zu teuer der caesars salat war lecker allerdings mit zu wenig dressing ebenfalls zu teuer f√ºr den preis das war lecker und wirklich reichlich der preis war angemessen das bier sehr lecker unversch√§mt teuer ein glas f√ºr der ausblick auf den strip geht auf die gegen√ºberliegenen hotels die font√§nen vom bellagio kann man nur sehen wenn man sich ganz aussen die gel√§ndertische setzt dann sitzt man tags√ºber allerdings der prallen sonne man kann hier viele spiele spielen die √ºberall verteilt sind tischkicker jenga au√üerdem wie √ºblich den meisten gibt es einige fernseher meist mit sportsendungen wir hatten hier einen bezahlt f√ºr speisen getr√§nken es gab keine probleme bei der einl√∂sung nun zur rechnung es gibt las vegas eine handvoll l√§den die nehmen unversch√§mterweise eine concession fee h√∂he von es wird zwar auf der karte darauf hingewiesen aber ziemlich klein einer ecke okay wir wussten das vorher und hatten ja au√üerdem eine gute ersparnis durch den trotzdem empfinden wir diese concession fee als unversch√§mt vor allem da die preise hier eh schon gesalzen sind fazit wir w√ºrden hier nicht mehr hingehen wir fanden das essen als zu teuer und nur zum biertrinken ist es erst recht viel zu teuer,2
